# MGTSEnT
A pipeline to report the key information based on the output of Multilevel Genome Typing (MGT)  for global _Salmonella_ Enteritidis https://mgtdb.unsw.edu.au/enteritidis/

The key information includes:
1. Population structure of typed _Salmonella_ Enteritidis isolates.
2. Isolates belonging to the multidrug resistance associated MGT STs (sequence types). 
3. Summarisation of closely related clusters based on the highest reolution typing level MGT9 Genomic Cluster (GC).
4. Generating Microreact input for visualisation of a cluster of interest (i.e. MGT-GC based dentrogram, metadata table).
